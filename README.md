# Solar System

## Description
This solar system assignment was created to showcase our ability to grab data from a javscript objection notation(json file) and call it using a XHR request. Event Listeners and printing to the DOM were also utilized quite often in this project. The functionality of this project allows you to hover over each planet. If you click on the planet, then information about the planet should appear. To go back to the page as it was when loaded, you can click on the red "X". You can also search for planets by typing in a name and hitting the enter key in the search bar at the top of the page.
